            <p>My name is Yoon Ho Ryoo and I was born in Seoul, South Korea. I moved to the U.S. around the age of 3. I initially moved to Chicago, Illinois and then eventually moved over here after elementary school.
                <br><br>I am currently the Projection Manager at CGV Cinemas in SoCal which means I am the one in charge of maintaining all of the projectors, testing new upcoming films, and the like..
                <br><br>I've always liked everything in relation to technology from the hardware side of things to the software side as well. I've also built multiple computers for friends and family as well. Coding is something that I I have not yet
                immersed myself into, but that is the plan.
